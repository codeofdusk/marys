# Marys
A Python library to obtain dining hours and menus at Swarthmore College.

## Getting started
``` python console
>>> import marys
>>> m=marys.Menu()  # Fetch latest menus from The Dash
```

### JSON API
`Menu` objects make the full json API available, so programs that rely on it can start using Marys immediately.

```python console
>>> m["sharples"][0]["title"]
'Breakfast'
>>> m["sharples"][0]["enddate"]
'2022-02-14 09:30:00'
>>> m["sharples"][0]["description"]
"Soup Island: Oatmeal with Raisins, Craisins &amp; Cinnamon Sugar Main: Eggs to Order, Bacon, Chicken Sausage, Hashbrown Potatoes Phoenixes - Egg &amp; Cheese Sandwiches Chef's Choice of Waffles, French Toast or Pancakes Fresh Fruit, Selection of Bread, Bagels &amp; Spreads Yogurt, Granola &amp; Cereal Dessert: Baker's Choice of Pastry or Donuts"
```

### Conveniences
Marys adds extra features on top of the base API to ease access to the menu.

#### `cleaned_description`
While the original `description` is provided for backwards compatibility with the original JSON API, there is also a `cleaned_description` more suitable for use inside applications, with resolved HTML entities and cleaned-up formatting.

```python console
>>> m["sharples"][0]["cleaned_description"]
"Soup Island: Oatmeal with Raisins, Craisins & Cinnamon Sugar Main: Eggs to Order, Bacon, Chicken Sausage, Hashbrown Potatoes Phoenixes - Egg & Cheese Sandwiches Chef's Choice of Waffles, French Toast or Pancakes Fresh Fruit, Selection of Bread, Bagels & Spreads Yogurt, Granola & Cereal Dessert: Baker's Choice of Pastry or Donuts"
```

#### Access by meal period
`Menu` objects contain special `breakfast`, `lunch`, `dinner`, and `now` keys for accessing breakfast, lunch, dinner, or currently available meals respectively. Lunch automatically resolves to brunch when necessary.

```python console

#### Dining availability
Marys objects have an `open` property which states whether this object or descendants is open.

``` python console
>>> m.open  # Is anything open?
True
>>> m["sharples"].open  # Is Sharples open for any meal?
True
>>> m["sharples"][1]["title"]
'Continental Breakfast'
>>> m["sharples"][1].open  # Is continental breakfast available right now?
False
>>> m["dinner"].open  # Is dinner available anywhere right now?
True
```

#### String rendering
Marys objects have a complete string representation.

```python console
>>> str(m["tomorrow"])

#### Speech rendering
Marys objects can be rendered as [Speech Synthesis Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_Synthesis_Markup_Language) for voice assistants and speech systems.

```python console
>>> m["dinner"].ssml()
'At Sharples Dining Hall<break strength="weak"/>Dinner (from 4:00pm to 8:00pm) <break strength="weak"/>Tilapia with Seafood Sauce, Rice Pilaf<break strength="weak"/>Butternut and Sage Orzo ::vegan::, Seitan Chimichurri ::vegan::<break strength="weak"/>Tortilla Soup Bar, with Chips, Chicken, Rice, Black Beans, Corn, Jalapenos, Cheese, and Choice of Chicken or Vegan Broth<break strength="weak"/>Pennsylvania Blend, Cauliflower<break strength="weak"/>Soups:  Vegetable ::vegan::, Tomato<break strength="weak"/>Dessert:  Cupcakes<break strength="weak"/>'
```

If using this library with Amazon Alexa, Alexa emotions are supported.

```python console
>>> marys.Menu(data={})["breakfast"].ssml(dialect=marys.SSMLDialect.AMAZON)
'<amazon:emotion name="disappointed" intensity="medium">Dining is currently unavailable at this time!</amazon:emotion>'
```

#### Card rendering
Similarly to `ssml`, Marys objects can be represented as a card (object with title and content). These are useful for creating dialog boxes in graphical programs or textual responses for voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant.

```python console
>>> m["sharples"].card()
Card(title='At Sharples Dining Hall', content="Breakfast (07:30â€“09:30)\nSoup Island: Oatmeal with Raisins, Craisins and Cinnamon Sugar Main: Eggs to Order, Bacon, Chicken Sausage, Hashbrown Potatoes Phoenixes - Egg and Cheese Sandwiches Chef's Choice of Waffles, French Toast or Pancakes Fresh Fruit, Selection of Bread, Bagels and Spreads Yogurt, Granola and Cereal Dessert: Baker's Choice of Pastry or Donuts\nContinental Breakfast (09:30â€“10:30)\nServed by the Fireplace - Includes Selection of Breads and Bagels, Spreads, Yogurt and Granola, Cereal, Fresh Bakery Special or Donuts, Full Beverage Station with Coffee\nLunch (10:30â€“13:30)\nChicken Fingers and Fries Homestyle Tofu with Green Beans (vegan), Vegetable Lo Mein Cheesesteak Bar, with Vegan, Beef, and Chicken Options, and Toppings Corn, Peas Soups: Vegetable (vegan), Tomato Dessert: Hope's Homestyle Cookies, Homemade Vegan Cookies\nLite Lunch (13:30â€“16:00)\nIncludes Salad Bar and Deli with Selection of Breads and Wraps, Soups of the Day, Cereal and Granola, Ice Cream and Frozen Yogurt, Fresh Fruit, Full Beverage Station with Coffee\nDinner (16:00â€“20:00)\nTilapia with Seafood Sauce, Rice Pilaf Butternut and Sage Orzo (vegan), Seitan Chimichurri (vegan) Tortilla Soup Bar, with Chips, Chicken, Rice, Black Beans, Corn, Jalapenos, Cheese, and Choice of Chicken or Vegan Broth Pennsylvania Blend, Cauliflower Soups: Vegetable (vegan), Tomato Dessert: Cupcakes\n")
>>> m["sharples"].card().title
'At Sharples Dining Hall'
```

## Asynchronous programs
For programs using Python's coroutine (`async`/`await`) syntax, a coroutine is provided to asynchronously construct a `Menu` object. If your programs do not use the `async` or `await` keywords, you don't need to use this.

```python
m = await marys.Menu.asynchronous()
```

## What's with the name?
This library was named after Mary Kassab, a Sharples manager who often assisted me, a totally blind student, in navigating the dining hall.
